Encoding:
~~~For the Ascii question ; we should just change those ascii values 
to their corresponding charecters to get the flag . I have just printed
the charecters in a line .
















For the question xor properties ;

We will be xoring key2^key3 and key1 

And now we will be xoring flag^key1^key2^key3 with key1^key2^key3 

which we will be getting in the above step to get the flag
