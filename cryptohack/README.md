Encoding:



```Ascii:
For the Ascii question ; we should just change those ascii values to their corresponding charecters to get the flag . 
I have just printedthe charecters in a line .

Hex:
For the Hex question ; I have just converted the hex to text using the following command 
print(bytes.fromhex(arr).decode('utf-8'))

Base64:



```


















For the question xor properties ;

We will be xoring key2^key3 and key1 

And now we will be xoring flag^key1^key2^key3 with key1^key2^key3 

which we will be getting in the above step to get the flag
